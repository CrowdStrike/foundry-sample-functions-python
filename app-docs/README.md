# Foundry Sample with Python Functions

This sample is designed to show you how to use Python Functions in Falcon Foundry.

It contains several Python functions that show you how to:

- Integrate with workflows
- Use FalconPy
- Use FalconPy to invoke an API Integration
- Use FalconPy to store data in a collection
- Share code between functions

When you install this app, you will be prompted for ServiceNow credentials. You can create a developer account at https://developer.servicenow.com. If you'd rather not create an account, just fill in fake values when installing. You won't be able to test the ServiceNow API integration nor invoke the servicenow function if you use fake values.
